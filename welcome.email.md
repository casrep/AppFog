You will need to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation) to get the AppFog Command Line Interface (AF CLI) tool installed. You can then easily upload your content with our pure REST API.

```
$ sudo gem install af
$ af login
$ cd <app directory>
$ af push
```
Grabbing the code on another machine to edit and update it is extremely easy:

```
$ af pull <app name>
$ cd <app directory>
$ af update <app name>
```
Tunnel into your Postgres, MySQL or Mongo databases using [Caldecott](https://rubygems.org/gems/caldecott).

```
$ af tunnel <service name>
```
