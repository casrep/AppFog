### Getting Started

* [AppFog Users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/appfog-users)

You will need to install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation) to get the AppFog Command Line Interface (AF CLI) tool installed. You can then easily upload your content using the following commands with our pure REST API.

```
$ sudo gem install af
$ af login
$ cd path/to/my/app/src
$ af push
```
Grabbing the code on another machine to edit and update it is super easy too.

```
$ af pull <app name>
$ cd <appname>
$ vim
$ af update <app name>
```
Tunnel into your Postgres, MySQL or Mongo databases using [Caldecott](https://rubygems.org/gems/caldecott).

```
$ af tunnel <service name>
```
